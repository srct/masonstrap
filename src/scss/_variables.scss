// PRIMARY PALETTE -- SIGNATURE COLORS

/*
    Mason Green is a cool color that can represent nature, prosperity, renewal,
    growth, calm, and strength. Many of these attributes tie in with the themes
    and tone of the wording in the Message Map. The color may be used for either
    large areas of color or as an accent color.

/*
    Mason Gold is a very bold warm color that can represent optimism,
    enthusiasm, fun, clarity, and confidence â€” again many of the attributes
    described in the message map. Because it is such a dominant color, with few
    exceptions, a little Mason Gold goes a long way. The color is very effective
    used solely or with Mason green on publications and merchandise targeted at
    enhancing school spirit. Otherwise, it should be used primarily as an accent
    color and, with very rare exception, never as a type color.

// DEFAULT => PRIMARY + UNIVERSAL SUPPORTING COLORS

/*
    The secondary palette colors work well as accent colors or as subtle
    backgrounds behind typography or graphics. Darker colors may be used behind
    light-colored typography. Screens or tints of the supporting colors may be
    used to achieve the desired effect but should be used cautiously, as
    screening certain colors may result in undesirable pastels.
