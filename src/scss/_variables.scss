  The universal palette colors work well as accent colors or as subtle
  backgrounds behind typography or graphics. Darker colors may be used behind
  light-colored typography. Screens or tints of the supporting colors may be
  used to achieve the desired effect but should be used cautiously, as
  screening certain colors may result in undesirable pastels.

  The neutral palette can stand alone or be used to complement any of
  the other color palettes. A neutral tone is also a great bridge to drop
  between two colors from one of the other palettes. Using two strong colors
  from one of the other palettes with a neutral gives you flexibility without
  color overload.
